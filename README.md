# ECHOLENS  
Smart AI-Powered Surveillance System â€“ Real-time Event Detection & Reporting

## ðŸš€ Overview  
ECHOLENS is an AI-powered surveillance system that analyzes live streams or uploaded videos, detects critical events (e.g., theft, fights, accidents, vandalism), and generates descriptive reports in real time.  
It also integrates with **n8n workflows** to send automated alerts via Gmail and log data into Google Sheets.
